# This is a Test <br>
This is a test. This is only a test. The purpose of this test is to demonstrate typical usage of the [Markdown Language](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) on a [GitHub](www.github.com) page. The Markdown formatting language is helpful to those
who are constantly publishing online material, but don't want code it all in HTML. <br>
### Why Markdown? <br>
Markdown uses some of the best features from different web platforms like [@twitter](www.twitter.com), without all of the
rote memorization that is required to effectively program in [HTML](http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm). <br>
### Features <br>
Markdown features a number of text styles that the user can easily add to any .md file such as ~strikethrough text~, _italicized text_ , and **bold text**. Honestly, the last thing any reader wants to see when they open what they thought would be an interesting file is a giant wall of text that lacks any kind of formatting. <br><br>

### Cool Formatting Abilities <br>
The Table feature allows for the creation of aethetically pleasing tables, that do not require a ton of time to format: <br>

The Most Expensive Films of All Time | Budget ($ Millions)
-------|-------
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides | $378.5
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End | $300
Avengers Age of Ultron | $279.9
John Carter | $263.7
Tangled | $260

<br>

There is some dispute about the veracity of this list for a number of reasons:
* The nature of Hollywood accounting is very secretive.
* The full scope of the budget is not always included in such figures.
* Hollywood producers and accountants may purposefully misrepresent the costs associated with the film's production.

### Conclusion <br>
This concludes the test of establishing and publishing a new branch on a cloned version of the ATSD Use Cases Repository.

The State of Connecticut is consistently ranked among the top 10 states in the union having
the biggest problems with illicit drug abuse. This assessment is based on a number of metrics
such as law enforcement contact with drug offenders and the number of people currently in custody
for drug related offenses coupled with the number of annual deaths from drug use. The State
of Connecticut has released comprehensive data of accidental drug related deaths for the years
2012 to late 2015 which includes data separated by a number of variables including age, race, sex, 
location, and the specific drug responsible for the fatal overdose. Using this data, correlations 
could be drawn between drug use and age, drug use and poverty (based on local income statistics),
type of drug use and gender.

Heart disease is responsible for the death of 1 in 4 Americans, is the single-leading cause of
premature death in the country, and is considered to be one of the most easily preventable as well.
The National Health Interview Survey has been observing trends in American heart disease for half a century
and this data concerns the frequency of a number of heart disease-related indicators across the
entirety of the American population, conveniently, it is further broken down to observe trends 
by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. This data set contains official CDC data from the years
2001 to 2014 highlighting the country's most recent efforts.

On April 1st, 2009 the federal excise tax on cigarettes more than doubled overnight, having been
raised from $0.39 to $1.01 as a result of  the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization 
Act of 2009 signed by then-President Barack Obama in February. This increase was the single 
largest increase in U.S. cigarette taxes in the nation's history and was signed in response to
the rising amount of cigarette-related mortality and morbidity and the administration's continued 
efforts to see the passage of the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, which would ultimately
be passed after a long series of reforms in 2010. Casualty statistics released by the Center 
for Disease Control detail the rising trend in cigarette-related health issues, which could be
passed on to American taxpayers in the form of higher overall premiums for their participation
in the socialized medical care programs of the ACA. CDC data examines a number of cigarette-related
problems on a state-by-state, and case-by-case basis over a time period of five years.

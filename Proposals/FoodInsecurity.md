America is considered to be a land of plenty, but time series data published by the 
City of New Orleans shows that an average of between 16% and 18% of residents in observed cities 
are currently living with food insecurity. Food insecurity is defined as a consistent lack of
access to food because of limited money or other resources. The data spans a five year period and
contains information for a number of southern United States cities.

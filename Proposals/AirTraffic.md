During the worst years of the Great Recession, people the world over saw a stagnation in their wages that naturally led
to the contraction of a number of product and service driven spheres. Thanks to the recent publication of data from the 
City of San Francisco, home to one of the busiest international airports in the world, these effects can be 
examined during the peak years of the downturn. Using information about the number of passengers aboard a wide range of
domestic and international airlines throughout the worst years of the recession, including 2009, the only year
that saw the recession reach global proportions, we can look at the effects of the lack of growth in a sector that
is used by a broad spectrum of people, for both business and pleasure.

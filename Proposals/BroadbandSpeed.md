The largest internet service providers are constantly making claims of having the fastest internet
connections available in a given market, and are in constant competition with one another to exceed
each other's capabilities. The City of Seattle has put these claims to the test and released
data that compares the advertised and actual performance of the complete range of ISPs available
to consumers on the Seattle market. The data covers only two years, but the scope of the data is
so wide that the possibilities for comparison are quite large. Figures for price are also
included which adds another interesting dimension to the data.

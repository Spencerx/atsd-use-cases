The American Fitness Index is a quantitative measure of the overall level of fitness of the 50
most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. Started in 2008 by the American College of
Sports Medicine, the AFI attempts to record progress made by major U.S. cities in the fight 
against obesity and poor overall health. Covering a period of six years, and published by the City
of New Orleans, the data set includes several major southern cities, a region in the U.S. that 
has historically been the heartland of American obesity. The rankings are based on a simple 100 
point scale that takes into account a number of determiners of overall health such as death from
preventable causes, chronic health conditions, social demographics that relate to overall health,
built environment, and available recreational resources.

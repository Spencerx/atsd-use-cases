In 2015, New York’s manufacturing sector
accounted for about 6% of private sector
jobs in New York State, according to the
Quarterly Census of Employment and
Wages (QCEW). However, this statewide
figure masks an important difference in the
concentration of factory jobs between the
Upstate and Downstate regions.
More specifically, about 12% of private
sector jobs in the 52-county Upstate
region are found in manufacturing. This
is more than three times greater than
the percentage of manufacturing jobs in
the 10-county Downstate region (3.4%).
Looked at another way, Upstate only
accounts for about 30% of private sector

jobs in the state, but it has a 60+% share
of New York’s factory jobs.
In some Upstate region counties,
manufacturing accounts for a significantly
higher share of employment. There are
eight counties where the factory sector
was responsible for at least 25% of
private sector jobs in 2015. They include:
Chenango (35%), Tioga (34%), Delaware
(30%), Lewis (27%), Washington (27%),
Wayne (27%), Seneca (26%) and Orleans

The Mohawk Valley’s Turnaround Continues
by Mark Barbano, Labor Market Analyst, Mohawk Valley
Focus on the Mohawk Valley
EMPLOYMENT IN NEW YORK STATE APRIL 2015
2
The Mohawk Valley’s economy has been
in expansion mode recently. The region’s
private sector job count rose by 580, or 0.4%,
in 2015, and by another 2,050, or 1.4%, in
2016, according to data from the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW).
The region’s 2016 private sector job count
is the highest since 2008. (Note: All QCEW
job data presented in this article refer to
the average monthly job count for JanuarySeptember.)
The region’s recent job growth has helped
to drive down the local unemployment
rate over this time frame. From 2014 to
2016, the Mohawk Valley’s annual average
unemployment rate dropped from 6.4% to
5.1%, reaching its lowest level since 2007.
Growing Industries
Five industries were responsible for more
than three-quarters (77%) of the region’s
net job gain in 2015-16. Social assistance
employment rose by 720, or 8.2%, in 2015-
16. The industry is at its highest employment
level on record. Since 2008, employment
has grown by 2,230, or 30.5%. The annual
average wage in this industry is $23,410.
The most common occupations include:
personal care aides; home health aides;
teacher assistants; preschool teachers; and
social and human service assistants.
Employment in the region’s warehousing
and storage industry rose by 290, or 8.2%,
in 2015-16. The local sector is dominated by
large distribution centers that primarily serve
national retailers such as Walmart, Target
and Family Dollar. The annual average
wage in this industry is $40,760, more than
8% higher than the region’s private sector
average ($37,600). Typical job titles in this
industry include: hand laborers and freight,
stock and material movers; hand packers
and packagers; forklift operators; stock clerk
and order fillers; and heavy and tractortrailer
truck drivers.
The warehousing and storage industry is
expected to receive a significant boost in
the coming years as two national retailers
-- Dollar General and Tractor Supply – plan
to build distribution centers in the region.
Dollar General will invest $91 million in a
facility in Montgomery County, which will
employ 430 workers. It is expected to open
in fall 2018. Tractor Supply is looking to build
a $80 million distribution center in Herkimer
County. The facility is expected to be
operational by the end of 2018 and create
350 full-time jobs within six years.
From 2015 to 2016, employment at local
food service and drinking places expanded
by 240, or 1.9%. The annual average
wage in this industry is $16,110, due to the
high concentration of part-time workers.
However, this sector offers excellent
opportunities for first-time workers and
students and retirees looking for part-time
employment. This industry is at its alltime
highest employment level. Common
occupations include: waiters and waitresses;
food prep and serving workers; cooks; firstline
supervisors; and bartenders.
Local fabricated metal manufacturers added
190 jobs in 2015-16, which translates into
a growth rate of 6.7%. The annual average
wage in this industry is $46,390, which is
more than 23% above the region’s annual
private sector average. Typical job titles
include: machinists; team assemblers;
welders, cutters, solderers and brazers;
production supervisors; and computercontrolled
machine tool operators.
Rounding out the list of the region’s top
five job gainers of 2016 is accommodation.
This industry’s job count grew by 150, or
8.1%. It has grown by 530, or 36.1%, since
2008. Private development near Turning
Stone Casino has contributed to increased
demand at local hotels and motels. This
industry has an annual average wage
of $22,080, due to the part-time status
of a large portion of workers. Common
occupations in this sector include: maids
and housekeeping cleaners; hotel, motel
and resort desk clerks; waiters and
waitresses; maintenance and repair workers;
and janitors and cleaners.
Summary
With private sector jobs now at an eight-year
high, the regional economy is poised for
continued growth. The opening of the Dollar
General and Tractor Supply distribution
centers will add to the job totals and solidify
the region's position as the distribution
capital of the state.
Growing Manufacturing Industries… from page 1
Continued on page 3
(first three quarters of each year). Over this
time frame, nine manufacturing industries
in New York State added at least 600 jobs,
including three that grew by at least 1,300.
The table on page 3 shows more details
about this group of industries.
Retail bakeries (NAICS 311811) had the
largest statewide increase in manufacturing
jobs (+3,110) between 2011 and 2016. Firms
in this industry tend to be clustered near
population centers where their customers
reside. As a result, more than 85% of retail
bakery jobs are found in New York City,
Long Island or the Hudson Valley region.
Breweries (NAICS 312120) also experienced
strong employment growth in 2011-16, adding
1,370 jobs. Much of this growth stems from
the state’s burgeoning craft beer industry.
Recent changes in New York State law, such
as the new “Farm Brewery” license, have
helped to successfully grow and expand this
segment of the brewing industry.
Dairy products (NAICS 311511) had the third
largest jobs increase (+1,310) between 2011
and 2016. This reflects, in part, the ongoing
popularity of Greek-style yogurt. As expected,
most of these jobs are located Upstate, with
the Southern Tier (26.8%) and Western New
York (21.4%) regions together accounting for
just under 50% of the industry total.
The fourth largest jobs increase was in
motor vehicle parts (NAICS 336390), which
added 1,010 jobs in 2011-16. Companies in
this line of work make a wide variety of auto
parts, such as air bag assemblies, wheels,
radiators, mufflers and catalytic converters.
Over 90% of industry employment in the
state is found in either Western New York
(62.3%) or the Southern Tier (30.7%).
The railroad rolling stock industry (NAICS
336510) added 870 jobs during the study
period. More than 40% of industry jobs
in New York are found in the Southern
Tier, which is home to several large railcar
makers. These include Elmira HeightsAPRIL

Finger Lakes region holding the largest
share of jobs (25.8%) in the state.
The commercial bakery industry (NAICS
311812) added a total of 820 jobs over the
study period. Like retail bakeries, most jobs
(71.4%) in this industry are found in New York
City, Long Island or the Hudson Valley.
Wineries (NAICS 312130) have been on
a tear over the past five years, adding a
total of 690 jobs in New York State. It will
come as no surprise to most readers that
the Finger Lakes, which is by far the largest
wine-producing region in the state, accounts
for almost half (44.1%) of industry jobs.
Companies in the toilet preparation industry
(NAICS 325620) blend, compound and
package perfumes, shaving cream, face
creams and lotions (including sunscreens).
Jobs in this industry grew by 610 in New
York State in 2011-16. Like retail and
commercial bakeries, most jobs (89.7%) in
this industry are found in New York City,
Long Island or the Hudson Valley.
Summary
New York’s manufacturing sector remains
an integral part of the state’s economy, with
most factory jobs located in the 52-county
Upstate region. The group of manufacturing
industries adding the most jobs in recent years
is dominated by food and transportation.
